This is a simplified version of the existing Geant4 Hadrontherapy example.

See https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Geant4/AdvancedExamplesHadrontherapy for details of the original example.

This version reduces the original to simply be the phantom with detector. Future versions will include - 

- Complex phantom made from two (or more) materials which can be speicifed

- An exterior detector to quantify output from target phantom material

- Updated Physics lists to ensure all relevant processes are included.
